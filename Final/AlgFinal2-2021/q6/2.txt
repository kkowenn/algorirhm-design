What is the essential property of a bounding function that will guarantee the correctness of the 
depth-first search algorithm?

The essential property of a bounding function that guarantees the correctness of a depth-first search 
(DFS) algorithm is that it must satisfy the following conditions:

Monotonicity (or Non-Decreasing): The bounding function should be non-decreasing along the search tree. 
In other words, as the algorithm progresses deeper into the tree, the bounding function's value should 
either increase or remain the same. Formally, for any node u in the tree, if u is an ancestor of node v, 
then the bounding function value at node u should be less than or equal to the bounding function value at node v.

Mathematically, if f(u) represents the bounding function value at node u, and u is an ancestor of v, then f(u) <= f(v).
This property ensures that the bounding function always provides an upper bound on the potential solution's 
value, and it avoids situations where the bounding function incorrectly indicates that a branch has potential 
when it does not. Monotonicity guarantees that the DFS algorithm remains correct because it prunes branches 
based on a valid upper bound without compromising optimality.

In essence, a bounding function's monotonicity ensures that the algorithm's pruning decisions are made 
logically and do not lead to incorrect solutions. Without this property, the correctness of the DFS 
algorithm could be compromised, and it might not guarantee optimal or valid solutions.

Admissibility: The bounding function should be admissible, which means that it should provide a lower 
bound on the cost or value of the optimal solution. Formally, for any node v in the search tree, the 
bounding function value f(v) should always be less than or equal to the cost or value of the optimal 
solution from node v to a leaf node.

Mathematically, if f(v) represents the bounding function value at node v, and c*(v) represents the 
cost or value of the optimal solution from node v to a leaf node, then f(v) <= c*(v).
The admissibility property ensures that the bounding function does not overestimate the potential 
value of a branch, as it must always provide a lower bound on the true optimal solution value. 
When a bounding function is admissible, the depth-first search algorithm can confidently prune 
branches whose bounding function values exceed the current best-known solution, knowing that it 
is eliminating subproblems that cannot lead to a better (optimal) solution.

In summary, both monotonicity and admissibility are crucial properties of bounding functions 
in DFS algorithms. Monotonicity ensures that the bounding function guides the search correctly, 
and admissibility guarantees that it provides valid and safe pruning criteria while maintaining 
the correctness of the algorithm. Together, these properties help improve the efficiency of the 
DFS algorithm while ensuring the accuracy of its results.
